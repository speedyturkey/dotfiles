# ==> Caveats
# Please note that upstream has asked us to make explicit managing
# nvm via Homebrew is unsupported by them and you should check any
# problems against the standard nvm install method prior to reporting.

# You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:

#   mkdir ~/.nvm

# Add the following to ~/.zshrc or your desired shell
# configuration file:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
# /usr/local/opt/nvm will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
# upon upgrade/reinstall.

# Type `nvm help` for further information.
